# DeliverEat
Developed for the subject "Software Engineering" with my work group.  
The task was to implement a specific User Story using a programming language chosen by the group.  
The purpose was to become familiar with the concepts of agile requirements and in particular with User Stories in conjunction with the application of the corresponding SCM activities.
